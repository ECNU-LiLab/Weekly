### 本周已完成任务

1. 使用IMDB数据集进行实验
2. 整理实验结果

### 总结

首先是对IMDB数据集进行分析，了解数据集的结构。这数据集包含了50000条偏向明显的评论，其中25000条作为训练集，25000作为测试集。label为pos(positive)和neg(negative)。以下为其中一个样本的例子。

```
"? this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone’s really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert ? is an amazing actor and now the same being director ? father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for ? and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also ? to the two little boy’s that played the ? of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the ? list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don’t you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone’s life after all that was shared with us all"
```

IMDB数据集和SST2数据集有一个明显的区别，句子长度的变化，影评的句子长度非常的长，长的甚至超过了2000个词，这会使得后续GBDT的训练很难。考虑到这一部分，这里选择了GloVe.100词向量，也就是每个词的维度是100。通过一些尝试，训练了部分数据集进行尝试，神经网络精度在87%左右，使用GBDT进行拟合以后得到精度71%左右。

后续正在进行anchors和word importance的相关实验，目前anchors不为空的比率很低，并且有些样本会存在一定问题，正在进行相应的调整。
